Hi, I’m James Vilela-Slater.

I’m interested in developing creative tools.

I’m currently learning maya rigging & python scripting. 

I’m looking to collaborate on projects that improve my learning. 

Before I came across 3D animation rigging and fell in love,
coding was a mystery to me, now it's a part of my life and I never look back.
